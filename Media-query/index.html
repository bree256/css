            <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.
                "I was an EMT for many years before I Jolned the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experlence here. I signed up for the free Intro course and found it Incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

     <div class="box2">
        <p>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated
            " I started as a total newble with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a moblie engineer for a big company.
            This was one of the best Investments I've made in myself." </p>

     <div class="box3">
        <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
            " Before Jolning the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professlonals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of thelrs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dIsappolnt. They were very hands-on and I never had to walt long for assistance. The aglle team project, In particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level In a way that no tutorlal could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to It during Intervlews as an example of my developent experlence. It certalnly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recelving multiple offers. 100% recommend!" </p>

     <div class="box4">
        <p>An overall wonderful and rewarding experience
            "Thank you for the wonderful experlence! I now have a Job I really enjoy, and make a good Ilving while doing something I love." </p>
    </div>
     <div class="box5">
       <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.
        "The staff seem genulnely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out In the world and present myself as a capable Junior developer. The standard Is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an Incredible community of smart and amazing people."</p>
